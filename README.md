# COVID-19 case count in Germany by state, over time

The data set is provided via an HTTP API as well as through a comma-separated value (CSV) file.

- [CSV file](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/jgehrcke/covid-19-germany-gae/master/data.csv)
- HTTP API endpoint for the current state: https://covid19-germany.appspot.com/now
- HTTP API endpoint for historical data: https://covid19-germany.appspot.com/timeseries/DE-BY/cases

Note that https://covid19-germany.appspot.com/now is based on multiple sources
and reports the more recent case count.

More details below.

## Contact and questions

You probably have many questions, just as I did (and still do). Your feedback and questions are highly appreciated!
Please use the [GitHub issue tracker](https://github.com/jgehrcke/covid-19-germany-gae/issues) (preferred)
or contact me via mail at jgehrcke@googlemail.com.

## Data sources and flow

These are official numbers published by individual state health ministries in
Germany.

The numbers from the individual (hundreds of) public German health offices
(Gesundheits√§mter) are first collected and aggregated on the state level, by
the individual state health ministries. From here, they are further collected
and published through ["situation reports"](https://www.rki.de/DE/Content/InfAZ/N/Neuartiges_Coronavirus/Situationsberichte/Archiv.html)
by the Robert Koch-Institut (yielding the data points in this database before
March 17), but also by ZEIT ONLINE (yielding the data points in my database
from March 17 on).

In [this blog](https://gehrcke.de/2020/03/deutschlands-covid-19-fallzahlen-des-rki-und-der-who-haben-inzwischen-2-3-tage-verzogerung/)
post I explain why as of today the numbers reported in the RKI and WHO
situation reports lag behind by 1-3 days.

## CSV file

- The column names use the [ISO_3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:DE) code for individual state.
- The points in time are encoded using localized ISO8601 time string notation.

### Example: parsing and plotting

```python
import pandas as pd
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


df = pd.read_csv("data.csv", index_col=["time_iso8601"], parse_dates=["time_iso8601"])
df.index.name = "time"

df["DE-BW_cases"].plot(
    title="DE-BW confirmed cases", marker="x", grid=True, figsize=[12, 9]
)
plt.savefig("bw_cases_over_time.png", dpi=200)
```

## HTTP API

- The HTTP API is served under https://covid19-germany.appspot.com
- It is served by Google App Engine from a European data center
- The code behind this can be found in the `gae` directory in this repository.

## How to use the HTTP/JSON API

### Get the time series information for a specific German state:

First, construct the URL based on this pattern:

`https://covid19-germany.appspot.com/timeseries/<state>/<metric>`:

For `<state>` use the [ISO_3166](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISO_3166-2:DE) code, for `<metric>` use `cases` or `deaths`.

For example, to fetch the time evolution of the number of confirmed Covid-19 cases for Bayern (Bavaria):

```
$ curl -s https://covid19-germany.appspot.com/timeseries/DE-BY/cases | jq
{
  "data": {
    "2020-03-10T12:00:00+01:00": "314",
    "2020-03-11T12:00:00+01:00": "366",
    "2020-03-12T12:00:00+01:00": "500",
    "2020-03-13T12:00:00+01:00": "558",
    "2020-03-14T12:00:00+01:00": "681",
    "2020-03-15T12:00:00+01:00": "886",
    "2020-03-16T12:00:00+01:00": "1067",
    "2020-03-17T21:00:00+01:00": "1352",
    "2020-03-18T23:00:00+01:00": "1798"
  },
  "meta": {
    "info": "https://gehrcke.de/2020/03/covid-19-http-api-german-states-timeseries",
    "source": "Official numbers published by public health offices (Gesundheitsaemter) in Germany"
  }
}
```

The points in time are encoded using localized ISO8601 time string notation.
Any decent datetime library can parse that into timezone-aware native timestamp
representations.

### Get the current snapshot for all of Germany (no time series)

```
$ curl -s https://covid19-germany.appspot.com/now | jq
{
  "current_totals": {
    "cases": 12223,
    "deaths": 31,
    "recovered": 99,
    "tested": "unknown"
  },
  "meta": {
    "contact": "Dr. Jan-Philip Gehrcke, jgehrcke@googlemail.com",
    "source": "ZEIT ONLINE (aggregated data from individual ministries of health in Germany)",
    "time_source_last_consulted_iso8601": "2020-03-19T03:47:01+00:00",
    "time_source_last_updated_iso8601": "2020-03-18T22:11:00+01:00"
  }
}
```

Notably, the [Berliner Morgenpost](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/corona-virus-karte-infektionen-deutschland-weltweit/)
seems to also do a great job at _quickly_ aggregating the state-level data.
This API endpoint chooses either that source or ZEIT ONLINE depending on
the higher case count.

## Attribution

Shout-out to as well as from ZEIT ONLINE for continuously collecting and
publishing the state-level data with little delay.

Notably, the [Berliner Morgenpost](https://interaktiv.morgenpost.de/corona-virus-karte-infektionen-deutschland-weltweit/)
seems to do a similarly well job of _quickly_ aggregating the state-level data.

Quick aggregation is important during the phase of exponential growth.
